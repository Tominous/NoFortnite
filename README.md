# NoFortnite

Automatically bans any user playing the game when they start playing it.

## Hosting that thing yourself

* Go to the release page
* Download the latest one
* Extract the archive
* Open config.json
* Replace YOURTOKENHERE by your bot token
* Save & exit

Also to customize the activity to ban, open `config.json` and change the `unholyThingToBan`field to whatever you want

Run with `java -jar NoFortnite.jar`

Original idea by Cancerous#4859 and nocturnal#8804, developed by me
